Hello World project from GitHub Guides

Per the instructions fromt the hello-world guide, I am writing a bit about myself. 

In my free time, I am currently working on front-end web development in hopes I can move to a development position at some point. 
I believe this to be the best starting place for me to advance my career in that direction. 

I wanted to ensure that I had an understanding of everything that goes into a development position, and version control is one of those things.
